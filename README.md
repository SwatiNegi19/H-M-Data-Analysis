# H&M-Data-Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains the code and data for an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project on a dataset from H&M, a popular fashion retailer. The primary objective of this project is to gain insights into various aspects of H&M's business operations and customer behavior through data analysis and visualization.

# Data Analysis Process
## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

1. Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
2. Preprocessed the data to prepare it for analysis, including feature engineering and transformation as needed.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

1. Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables in the dataset.
2. Identified key trends, patterns, and insights related to H&M's business operations, customer behavior, and product performance.
## Data Visualization:

1. Created interactive visualizations and dashboards using Power BI to present the findings from the EDA in a clear and insightful manner.
2. Designed visualizations to highlight important metrics, trends, and insights for stakeholders.

# Tools and Technologies Used

1. Python: Data manipulation and analysis
2. Power BI: Data visualization and dashboard creation
